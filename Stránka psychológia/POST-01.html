    <h3>
        Impostor syndrome, also known as impostor phenomenon or impostorism, is a psychological occurrence in which people doubt their skills,
        talents, or accomplishments and have a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as frauds.[1] Despite external evidence of their competence, those experiencing this
        phenomenon do not believe they deserve their success or luck. They may incorrectly attribute it to the Matthew effect or the Dunning–Kruger effect, or they may think that they
        are deceiving others because they feel as if they are not as intelligent as they outwardly portray themselves to be.
        Impostor syndrome can stem from and result in strained personal relationships and can hinder individuals from achieving their full potential in their fields of interest.<hr>
